# SINGLE-CYCLE
We begin constructing the datapath by connecting the state elements (PC Counter, Instruction Memory, Register File, Data Memory) with combinational logic that can execute the various instructions. Control signals determine which specific instruction is performed by the datapath at any given time. 
The control unit contains combinational logic that generates the appropriate control signals based on the current instruction. Finally, we analyze the performance of the single-cycle processor.
